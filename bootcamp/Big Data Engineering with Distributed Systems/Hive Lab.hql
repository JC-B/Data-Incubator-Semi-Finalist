--1. Which Hive tables are present within this Hadoop cluster?
show tables;

--2. Let’s get information about hivesampletable.
describe hivesampletable;

--3. Let’s get a preview of our data. Use the “limit” clause
-- at the end of the HiveQL statement. The star tells Hive to
-- grab each rows and limit returns X number of rows at random.
select *
from hivesampletable
limit 100;

--4. Include “set hive.cli.print.header=true;” to see headers.
set hive.cli.print.header=true;
select *
from hivesampletable
limit 100;

--5a.Count(*) is the command to count all rows.
select count(*)
from hivesampletable;

--print the first 20 entries where the device maker
--starts with HTC.
select *
from hivesampletable
where devicemake like "HTC%"
limit 20;

--see the first 20 entries where client dwell time exceeded
--20 seconds. These people are probably the more interested
--customers. Let’s isolate them.
set hive.cli.print.header=true;
select *
from hivesampletable
where querydwelltime > 20
limit 20;

--3. What was the average dwell time? Run the following
--query to find out.
select "average dwell time", avg(querydwelltime)
from hivesampletable;

--4. find the min, max, variance, and sum of the dwell time.
select
 "max", max(querydwelltime),
 "min", min(querydwelltime),
 "variance", variance(querydwelltime),
 "sum", sum(querydwelltime)
from hivesampletable;

--5. Run the query below to print the 10 largest dwell time
-- in descending order.
select clientid, querydwelltime
from hivesampletable
order by querydwelltime desc
limit 10;

--6. What is the distribution of our devices? Run the
--following query to find the total devices for each brand.
set hive.cli.print.header=true;
select devicemake, count(*)
from hivesampletable
group by devicemake;

--7. The next query renames the queried columns using
--the “as” clause.
set hive.cli.print.header=true;
select devicemake as device_make, count(*) as device_total
from hivesampletable
group by devicemake;

--8. Let’s get the frequency counts by devices where dwell
--times where higher than 20 second. This will filter out
--the devices that aren’t generating enough engagement.
set hive.cli.print.header=true;
select devicemake as Device, count(*) as Total
from hivesampletable
where querydwelltime > 20
group by devicemake;

--9. To focus on the top brands, let’s include those with
--100 dwell times greater than 20 seconds. Use the “HAVING”
--clause since the filter occurs after the grouping.
set hive.cli.print.header=true;
select devicemake as Device, count(*) as Total
from hivesampletable
where querydwelltime > 20
group by devicemake
having Total > 100;

--let’s print the previous query in descending order by using
--the “sort by” clause.  Limit the query to the 7 most engaging
--brands.
set hive.cli.print.header=true;
select
devicemake as Device,
count(*) as Total
from hivesampletable
where querydwelltime > 20
group by devicemake
having Total > 100
sort by Total desc
limit 7;
